\part{OSI Layer 1 --- Physical}

The physical layer of APRS defines the different signalling methods used
to transport datalink layer packets from one node to another across one of
the several physical channels typically used in the APRS network.


\chapter{Bell 202 on RF}

The most common layer 1 used for APRS on RF is a variant of the
Bell 202 audio frequency shift keyed (AFSK) modem transmitted via 
FM VHF radios. In North America, the primary frequency of operation is
144.390MHz, but differs by country based on local band limitations.

Bell 202 was originally  based on switching between 1200Hz and 2200Hz tones to
represent a binary one or zero respectively. Due to Amateur radio operators
using Bell 202 as a physical layer below AX.25, which ultimately derived 
from HDLC, the original 1200Hz mark and 2200Hz space symbols are not used;
the layer 2 data stream is encoded using 
non-return to zero, inverted (NRZI),
which requires zeros in the original bit stream to be encoded as a change
between 1200Hz and 2200Hz and ones to be encoded as transmitting the same
symbol during the next symbol period as during the prior.

\section{Stages of a Bell 202 Transmission}

Channel idle state; string of zeros for clock sync

At least one flag octet 0x7E

AX.25 UI frame with bit stuffing

Frame Check Sum; 16 bit CCITT CRC

At least one flag octet 0x7E

Release of channel or an additional AX.25 frame and flag. 

\section{Performance Implications of Bell 202 Modems}

TODO No FEC is severe limitation

TODO Emphasis / deemphasis problem is unsolvable

TODO Define Basic 3002 phone channel as good benchmark

\chapter{KISS}

KISS (``Keep It Simple, Stupid") is a protocol originally presented by 
Mike Chepponis, K3MC and Phil Karn, KA9Q at the 6th ARRL Computer Networking
Conference in Redondo Beach, CA in 1987 as an extension to the Serial Line 
Internet Protocol (SLIP) described in RFC 1055 allowing for in-band signalling from 
the host to the Terminal Node Controller (TNC) to enable setting modem 
configuration parameters. 

During the early 1980's, the expectation was that the TNC would be handling 
the entire packet protocol stack up to the final presentation to the user, which
could conceivably be done using a dumb terminal such as a VT100 or line printer 
and a keyboard. 
Once personal computers became affordable in the late 1980's, the expectation that
the entire application stack would run on the embedded TNC became severely limiting
and KISS emerged as the solution to expose the modems inside TNCs via 
an eight bit clean interface.

TODO Describe typical application of KISS in node.

TODO Being 8 bit clean is a huge advantage.

TODO Doesn't allow for TNC to host message passing
