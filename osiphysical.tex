\part{OSI Layer 1 --- Physical}

The physical layer of APRS defines the different signalling methods used
to transport datalink layer packets from one node to another across one of
the several physical channels typically used in the APRS network.


\chapter{Bell 202 on RF}

The most common layer 1 used for APRS on RF is a variant of the
Bell 202 audio frequency shift keyed (AFSK) modem transmitted via 
FM VHF radios. In North America, the primary frequency of operation is
144.390MHz, but differs by country based on local band limitations.

Bell 202 was originally  based on switching between 1200Hz and 2200Hz tones to
represent a binary one or zero respectively. Due to Amateur radio operators
using Bell 202 as a physical layer below AX.25, which ultimately derived 
from HDLC, the original 1200Hz mark and 2200Hz space symbols are not used;
the layer 2 data stream is encoded using 
non-return to zero, inverted (NRZI),
which requires zeros in the original bit stream to be encoded as a change
between 1200Hz and 2200Hz and ones to be encoded as transmitting the same
symbol during the next symbol period as during the prior.

\section{Stages of a Bell 202 Transmission}

Channel idle state; string of zeros for clock sync

At least one flag octet 0x7E

AX.25 UI frame with bit stuffing

Frame Check Sum; 16 bit CCITT CRC

At least one flag octet 0x7E

Release of channel or an additional AX.25 frame and flag.
