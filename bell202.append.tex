\chapter{SLottime Justification}
\label{sec:vhftxrx}

The SLottime parameter of modems is dependent upon the total time
it takes for one station to begin transmitting and for receiving stations
to subsequently identify the channel as occupied.
This sequence can be broken into the following stages:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Transmitter key-up from standby (RX-TX turnaround time)
	\item RF propagation from transmitter to receiver (negligible)
	\item Receiver opening squelch and delivering AFSK signal to modem
		(While not usually measured, a representative measurement is
		the TX-RX turnaround time \cite{pattersoninterview})
	\item Modem Data Carrier Detect (DCD) of the received signal
\end{itemize}

%\caption{RX-TX and TX-RX turnaround times for VHF mobile radios as published in QST}
\end{center}

Since most Amateur Bell 202 packet activity is done using amateur VHF mobile radios,
a survey was performed of ARRL QST magazine hardware reviews published on VHF-capable
mobile radios since 1999.
These reviews included RX-TX and TX-RX turnaround times
which indicate that a significantly longer SLottime is needed than the 
traditionally suggested 100ms. 
This is due to \emph{none} of the evaluated radios
being fast enough to key up, a second radio to open squelch, 
and then allow any time for modem DCD before the end of a slot.

The author suggests that a new default of 300ms SLottime be considered.
This value allows many more radios to be able to detect a transmission
in progress before the expiration of the slot time, based on the values
collected above.
