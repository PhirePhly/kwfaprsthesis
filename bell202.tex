\chapter{Amateur Bell 202}
\label{chap:bell202}

This chapter considers the most popular modulation used in amateur
packet radio, Amateur Bell 202. 
The primary points made will be:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Pointing out that what amateur radio operators call ``Bell 202"
		implicitly extends well beyond the original Bell 202 specification.
		Therefore, the new term ``Amateur Bell 202"
		is proposed to differentiate between the entire modem and the 
		underlying modulation.
	\item Drawing a new line between AX.25 and Amateur Bell 202 to make it clear
		that error detection is a concern for the modem and not the 
		data link protocol.
	\item Presenting a reference implementation of the checksum used
		to detect transmission errors in Amateur Bell 202 frames.
	\item Discussing how the baseband modem signal should be modulated using
		VHF voice radios and what challenges this presents
		to modem performance.
\end{itemize}

Despite Amateur Bell 202 often being decried for its age and 
vastly outliving its usefulness,
it can't be denied that it is still an integral part of the amateur radio
digital communications landscape.
While its deficiencies dictate that Amateur Bell 202 will rarely be the best
choice for new packet radio networks, 
its relative simplicity causes
Amateur Bell 202 to be an appealing gateway into the digital communications hobby.

\section{Bell 202 in Amateur Radio}
\label{sec:bell202history}

Bell 202 is an audio frequency shift keyed (AFSK) modulation that
encodes data by shifting a 1700Hz carrier down and up 500Hz (which
produces 1200Hz and 2200Hz tones).
These tones represent a binary one and zero respectively and transitions occur
at a rate of 1200 symbols per second.
Originally developed by AT\&T for use on the telephone network \cite{202tspec},
Bell 202 was popular among amateur radio operators due to the abundance
of modems available on the second-hand market in 1981 when the FCC authorized
amateur packet operations in the United States \cite{gatewaypacket}.

	This paper refers to the entirety of layer 1 as ``Amateur Bell 202"}
	\label{fig:osibell}
\end{figure}

There isn't a particularly clean
mapping of packet radio protocols to the seven layers of the OSI
network model, but one can be formed 
to help clarify references to the different layers in this paper.
Figure \ref{fig:osibell} shows the ISO model which will be used in
the rest of this paper.
Due to Amateur radio operators
using Bell 202 as the modem below AX.25, which is a derivative of
the X.25 network protocol \cite[\S1.1]{ax25spec}, 
the physical layer implicitly includes the High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC) 
protocol for framing and bit stuffing \cite{n1vgphy}.
Since using HDLC with Bell 202 modems is so implicit in amateur radio systems, 
the layer 1 packet protocol should be called ``Amateur Bell 202," to
distinguish it from the original Bell 202 developed by AT\&T.

One implication of using HDLC is that frames are not encoded using the
1200Hz mark and 2200Hz space symbols of traditional Bell 202,
but instead use an
inverted non-return to zero (NRZI) encoding.
NRZI calls for zeros in the original bit stream to be encoded as a
continuous-phase frequency transition between consecutive symbols, 
while ones are encoded as
the lack of a frequency change between two symbols \cite{iso13239}.
Figure \ref{fig:bell202sample} shows a typical Amateur Bell 202
signal representing the ASCII letter ``A," starting with the least significant bit.

\section{Amateur Bell 202 Transmission Format}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{src/dia/bell202}
	\caption{Amateur Bell 202/HDLC frame format}
	\label{fig:bell202format}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:bell202format} shows the format of a typical single-frame
Amateur Bell 202 transmission, as it is based on HDLC.
There are a number of important facets to note:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The leading 0x00 octets are mentioned in very few documents
		discussing Amateur Bell 202, yet they reportedly improve modem
		throughput \cite{millerinterview}\cite{aprsunveiled}. 
		0x00 encoded in NRZI causes a symbol transition
		every clock cycle and thus provides a more effective clock 
		synchronization target than the originally specified 0x7E octets. 
		0x7E is actually 
		the longest allowable string of 1s in the frame and 
		therefore has the lowest amount of energy at the clocking frequency,
		which causes it to be the \emph{worst} 
		octet for asynchronous clock recovery.
	\item The octet 0x7E is used to indicate the beginning and end of 
		HDLC frames.
		There is little guidance on the number of flag octets needed before
		or after frames in Amateur Bell 202 (represented by N2 and N3 in 
		Figure \ref{fig:bell202format})
		beyond stating that there must be at least one of each. 
	\item The sum of
		N1 and N2 is variable in most modems via the ``TXDelay" parameter,
		which specifies how long the preamble should be, in 10ms increments.
	\item It is permissible to encode multiple 
		frames per transmission, yet there is no guidance as to how
		many octets of 0x7E should be included between them;
		most modems insert several 0x7E octets between 
		frames.\footnote{For a specific example, the Argent Data OT3m TNC 
			with firmware r56474 inserts 3 flags before
		a frame, 7 flags between two frames, and 5 flags after the final frame.}
		Tests indicate that many demodulators are sensitive to the number of flags 
		before, between, and after frames as mentioned in the last three points.
		Finding definitive minimums would require testing a representative
		sample of the
		popular Amateur Bell 202 modems, which is beyond the author's resources.
	\item The frame payload and frame checksum must be modified such 
		that no string of more than five 1's happen to appear in a row.
		This is done by ``bit-stuffing" the transmitted bitstream by
		appending a zero after any string of five ones at the transmitter,
		and subsequently dropping this zero following five ones at the 
		receiver.\footnote{Six ones in a row represent a 0x7E flag indicating 
			the end of a frame or an idle carrier.
			Seven or more ones in a row indicate an invalid channel state
			that shouldn't happen, but regularly does, so modems must be 
			able to handle arbitrary strings of ones gracefully.}
	\item Every octet is encoded and transmitted least-significant bit first,
		except for the CRC-16-CCITT frame checksum, 
		which is transmitted big-endian
		and most-significant bit first.
		\cite[\S3.8]{ax25spec},
		\cite[\S8.1.1-2]{ituv42},
		\cite{n1vgphy}.
		See Section \ref{calcfcs} for further discussion.
	\item The minimum and maximum payload sizes indicated in Figure 
		\ref{fig:bell202format} aren't enforced by any properties of 
		Bell 202 or HDLC, but from the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU)
		specified in the layer 2 AX.25 network protocol.
		Larger frames are possible and were often used in specialized 
		AX.25 and IPv4 packet networks \cite{pattersoninterview}.
		A practical upper limits on frame size is enforced by
		the need for successful frames to be completely error-free.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Excluding HDLC from Layer 2 AX.25}

It is important to note that the presentation of the HDLC framing
and checksum
in Figure \ref{fig:bell202format} as part of the layer 1 modulation 
instead of as part of the layer 2 AX.25 frame is 
novel to this work and hasn't been seen in any of the existing literature.
The ISO network model would also disagree with this classification,
but the author's main objective is to decouple HDLC from AX.25.
This change is suggested because including the frame checksum and flags
in the layer 2 documentation confuses the separation between Amateur Bell 202 
and AX.25, which should be independent protocols.

This is particularly important when AX.25 packets are transported across 
other layer 1 links which use their own framing protocols.
The Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS) serial link between 
a host system and modem is the most notable
transport where the HDLC fields are not included in outgoing frames, 
and are instead 
post-facto generated by the modem during transmission\footnote{The opposite
	is also true; incoming frames with correct checksums have them stripped,
	and incorrect checksums cause the frame to be dropped and never
transported over the KISS link.} \cite{KISSspec}.
M. Chepponis and P. Karn made the technically correct decision of excluding 
HDLC framing from the AX.25 payload when developing KISS, but this causes
an unfortunate situation where KISS is transporting an entirely
undocumented fragment of the AX.25 packet. Figure \ref{fig:ax25format} 
presents the AX.25 layer 2 protocol as it should be documented without
the layer 1 HDLC framing.

Removing HDLC from AX.25 also permits any researchers developing new
amateur radio packet modems to select a different framing protocol
with more desirable properties, such as forward error correction.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Calculating the Frame Check Sum}
\label{calcfcs}


The Frame Check Sum (FCS) used for error detection in Amateur Bell 202
is the well-known CRC-16-CCITT, 
which enjoys a wide deployment in network protocols and 
systems.\footnote{Example systems using CRC-16-CCITT include HDLC, 
	Bluetooth, the XMODEM file 
transfer protocol, and SD cards.}
Unfortunately, the language used in \S4.2.5 of the ISO specification for
HDLC \cite{iso13239} is particularly awkward, 
and does not lend itself well to implementation.
For the sake of clarity, Figure \ref{fig:crcccittcode} 
presents one possible algorithm to
calculate the FCS of a complete frame, which is implemented in ANSI C in 
Appendix \ref{sec:crcref}.
The constant 0x8408 comes from a bit reversal of the 0x1021 generator polynomial
since the presented algorithm calculates the CRC in bit reversed order.

The order of the two octets and bit order of the checksum 
as transmitted over the air 
is particularly muddled in the existing amateur radio literature.
Many sources call for sending the
checksum little-endian, while ITU V.42 \S8.1.2.3 clearly specifies big-endian,
as is the convention for most network protocols.
The original specifications also call for transmitting the checksum most
significant bit (MSb) first, which is the opposite of the payload octets.
This exception is noted in \S3.8 of the AX.25 specification as well.

This creates plenty of confusion on the part of implementers, 
which is likely caused by the fact that 
available reference implementations of the CCITT checksum don't
make it clear that they already integrate the needed bit reversal 
after the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) division and one's complement.
The algorithm presented in Figure \ref{fig:crcccittcode} 
\emph{does not} calculate the true CCITT CRC checksum, but
follows the convention of
calculating it in reverse-bit order, such that the final bit-reversal step 
may be omitted during modulation of the bit stream while using the LSb first
modulation subroutines already used for the payload data.
Therefore, the checksum as presented should be sent lower octet first, 
using the same modulator as for payload octets that modulates the 
least significant bit (LSb) first.
This ensures that the resulting checksum as transmitted will have the 
correct sequence, starting with the MSb and finishing with the LSb,
and is why many implementations appear to completely ignore the
need to send the FCS MSb.
Calculating the FCS in reverse bit order and then modulating it in LSb
is equivalent to originally sending it in MSb order,
and thus alleviates the need for 
the modulator to handle the FCS differently than the rest of the frame.

\section{FM Deviation and Emphasis}

Once the Amateur Bell 202 frame is generated, encoded using NRZI, and converted into
a baseband AFSK signal, it still needs to be converted into a VHF FM signal
and transmitted to other stations. 
Since Bell 202 was originally designed for telephone data service, 
the existing specifications give no guidance on the unique 
aspects of the amateur VHF FM physical layer. 
One such issue is what value of
FM deviation to target when setting modem audio levels.

While quantitatively justifying this value is beyond the ability of the
author, a proposed specification for FM deviation is 3.5kHz for both the
1200Hz and 2200Hz tones, or for the wider of the two tones if equal
deviation is not possible \cite{millerinterview}.

This proposal is complicated by two major issues: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The lack of availability of the necessary 
		test equipment to measure FM deviation.
	\item The inconsistency in pre-emphasis and de-emphasis filters
		used by individual network nodes.
\end{itemize}

The VHF deviation meter needed to properly set modem deviation is prohibitively
expensive for the typical packet radio operator, so presenting a figure 
such as 3.5kHz deviation to most users does little good.
Qualitative and home-brew solutions have been developed
for setting deviation levels \cite{n8urdev},
and these techniques should be better promoted until 
deviation meters become a more standard part of a packet operator's toolkit. 

Pre-emphasis and de-emphasis is a concept in FM voice communications where
higher baseband frequencies are modulated with larger deviation 
than lower frequencies
to provide a consistent signal-to-noise ratio across the channel.
Unfortunately, the advantages of these audio filters to packet operation 
are debatable, and they are not applied consistently. A single packet 
station is likely to have any permutation of pre-emphasized or flat 
transmit audio and de-emphasized or flat receive audio.
This means that even when one station deliberately uses flat audio,
there is no guarantee that it won't suffer from receiving another
station's pre-emphasized signal or be received by another station using de-emphasis.

Different types of Bell 202 modems vary in how sensitive they are to this high/low
pass filtering effect, but more importantly there is no benchmark established
for what level of pre-/de-emphasis a modem should tolerate.
One suitable source for such a benchmark would be to go back to the
telephone networks where Bell 202 was originally used.
Figure \ref{fig:3002} shows the allowable audio distortion of a basic type 3002
channel as used in the telephone network; any level of distortion that falls 
inside the shaded region relative to a test tone at 1004 Hz is considered 
acceptable \cite{alisouskas}.

For application to Amateur Bell 202, 
normalizing the distortion thresholds to 1004Hz is 
less important than simply noting that the allowable distortion between the two
tones of interest (1200Hz and 2200Hz) is 10dB in either direction.
An insightful measurement for Bell 202 modem designers would be testing how
quickly their modem's performance falls off as a packet signal approaches 
the $\pm$10dB limits.
Creating a test suite which could yield quantitative
measures of a modem's sensitivity to the pre-emphasis/de-emphasis issue would
be a valuable contribution beyond the scope of this paper.

\end{figure}


\section{Carrier Sense Multiple Access}
\label{sec:bell202csma}

Since Amateur Bell 202 is a half duplex modulation using re-purposed 
FM voice transceivers, 
one of the challenges to packet radio is avoiding multiple stations
transmitting on the same channel at once. 
This is done using Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA),
where each station listens before transmitting to see if the channel is clear.
Unlike other CSMA implementations,
such as IEEE 802.3 Ethernet, 
Amateur Bell 202 doesn't enjoy the advantage that transmitters can
at least sense when a collision has taken place 
and use that information to abort the transmission of the rest of the frame early.
When a collision takes place on an Amateur Bell 202 channel, 
both colliding frames are transmitted in their entirety, but both are lost
and the channel time wasted.

Besides the degenerate case of ignoring the current channel status completely when 
deciding to transmit a pending frame,\footnote{This is a surprisingly
	common channel access method, used primarily by what are called ``dumb" or
	``deaf" APRS trackers, which are transmit-only and lack an
FM receiver altogether.}
there are two popular algorithms used for
channel access in North America;
DWait and P-persistent.

DWait is a deterministic algorithm where each station is assigned a fixed
``quiet time" after the end of any other transmission 
before they will begin a locally pending transmission. 
This lends itself well to designed networks
where the relative priority of each station is known and a corresponding DWait time
is set for each station where a shorter DWait will 
always gain the channel over a longer one. 
Conversely, this doesn't lend itself well to ad-hoc networks,
since two stations that happen to both operate near one another 
with similar DWait parameters
will tend to collide and reduce throughput.

P-persistent is a stochastic algorithm that attempts to randomly spread
stations apart when the channel becomes clear. 
This is configured with two variables: the slot time (SLottime), and the
probability that a station should choose to transmit during a given slot (PErsist). 
The SLottime
should be set to as short of a time interval as possible during which a station can
reliably identify another station as transmitting 
before beginning its own transmission.
The PErsist value should be tuned based on how likely another station is to transmit 
during the same time slot considering the number of other stations with 
pending traffic attempting to gain the channel.

A typical modem supporting the p-persistent algorithm will need three values adjusted
based on the specific network hardware in use; PErsist, SLottime, and the 
transmitter preamble time TXDelay mentioned earlier in this paper.

\begin{itemize}
	\item PErsist: Measured in units of 1/256, the suggested default is
		63, which translates into a 0.25 chance of selecting a specific available
		slot \cite{KISSspec}. 
		A typical implementation selects a random number in the range
		[0,255] and tests if it is equal or less than the PErsist value.
		Therefore, a setting of 0 would result in a 0.004 chance of selecting 
		a slot and a setting of 255 would result in always selecting an open slot.
		The optimal value for a specific network is highly dependent on the
		local channel occupancy, so the suggested default shouldn't
		be considered definitive.
	\item SLottime: Measured in units of 10ms increments, the traditional
		default from sources such as the KISS specification and 
		Kantronics hardware 
		is a value of 10 (100ms) \cite{KISSspec}\cite{kamplusref}, 
		but performance measurements of contemporary VHF radios 
		indicate a need for a longer slot time. 
		The new suggested value is 30 (300ms), which is discussed further
		in Appendix \ref{sec:vhftxrx}.
	\item TXDelay: Measured in units of 10ms increments, the suggested
		default is a value of 50, which translates into a 500ms synchronization
		preamble from when a transmitter is keyed up until when a payload
		frame is transmitted \cite{KISSspec}.
		This value is very conservative and can usually be reduced when
		receiving stations are properly configured with
		well aligned clock recovery mechanisms.
\end{itemize}

There are additional channel access methods beyond the two mentioned
that are applied in amateur radio packet networks. 
Examples include Demand Assigned Multiple Access (DAMA),
which is primarily used in European packet networks,
and Time Slotting, which is used in carefully designed high-throughput networks.
Since these alternatives see less application in American packet networks,
they are excluded from this discussion and the reader need only appreciate that
this is not a comprehensive survey of channel access methods.

\section{Conclusion}


By most measures, Amateur Bell 202 is a very poor performing modulation to
be used by amateurs for packet operations. 
One-bit symbols cause Bell 202 to suffer from poor spectral efficiency,
HDLC lacks any error correcting codes so single-bit errors cause entire 
frames to be dropped, and 1200 bits per second is a remarkably low
data rate when even consumer radio systems are operating at hundreds of millions
of bits per second throughput.

One aspect of Amateur Bell 202 that is appealing, other than the 
huge legacy systems still using it, is it's relative simplicity.
The fact that amateurs are able to implement Amateur Bell 202 modems on
systems as minimalistic as 8 bit microcontrollers, and that modems can 
interface with unmodified voice radios,
make it possible for amateur radio operators to build their
own APRS nodes with relatively little difficulty.

Faster data rates and more sophisticated modems aren't being discouraged,
but the value of being able to learn about amateur digital communications 
via the simplicity of Bell 202 shouldn't be discounted.
The public APRS networking is deeply entrenched in using Amateur Bell 202,
so exploring future enhancements to the Amateur Bell 202 modem is a
topic that begs for further examination.
