W6KWF thesis considering optimizations to the APRS network

This is the collection of work and documentation for my Masters Thesis
focusing on the current state of the APRS network and an attempt at
better documenting the stated goals of the network, the network protocols
used for the network, and suggestions on what parts of the protocol need
the most attention to move the APRS network forward.

This collection of writing is highly experimental and should not be used
as the primary source of justification for any production network 
deployments on the national 144.390MHz frequency.
