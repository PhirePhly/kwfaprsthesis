\begin{abstract}
The Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS) is an amateur radio packet 
network that has evolved over the last several decades in tandem with, 
and then arguably beyond, the lifetime of other VHF/UHF amateur packet
networks, to the point where it is one of very few packet networks left
on the amateur VHF/UHF bands. This is proving to be problematic due to
the loss of institutional knowledge as older amateur radio operators who
designed and built APRS and other AX.25-based packet networks abandon
the hobby or pass away. The purpose of this document is to 
collect and curate a sufficient body of knowledge to ensure the 
continued usefulness of the APRS network, and re-examining 
the engineering decisions made during the network's evolution to look for
possible improvements and identify deficiencies in documentation of
the existing network.
